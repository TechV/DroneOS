	  bluez utils version 5.x 
 
	  With this release BlueZ only supports the new Bluetooth Management 
	  kernel interface (introduced in Linux 3.4). 
	  For Low Energy support at least kernel version 3.5 is needed. 
 
	  The API is not backwards compatible with BlueZ 4. 
 
	  Bluez utils will use systemd and/or udev if enabled.
